hdrecover
---------

Attempts to recover a hard disk that has bad blocks on it.

WARNING: A hard disk with bad blocks on it is likely to fail! If you
value your data you should get a new hard disk instead of using this
program!

However, if you can't afford a new hard disk, or just like being
reckless with your data then this tool might just help you out!

Requirements:

* A 2.6 kernel
* A dead hard drive (well one with bad blocks - not completely dead)
* smartmontools is handy although not strictly needed
* root access

When to use:

First of all, if you haven't already got it - go download
smartmontools! (http://smartmontools.sf.net). Then run:

    smartctl -A /dev/hda

Where hda is whichever drive you're interested in. The output should
include three attributes that are interesting:

* Reallocated_Event_Count

  This is how many sectors have already been reallocated on the
  drive. We're hoping to get the hard disk to increase this number!

* Current_Pending_Sector

  The number of sectors that the drive thinks are dodgy. Bear in mind
  sometimes drives change their mind about whether a sector is bad or
  not - so this number can go down without a reallocation occuring.

* Offline_Uncorrectable

  This is the number of sectors that the drive has attempted to
  correct itself, but failed. Running the command:

      smartctl -t offline /dev/hda

  should cause the drive to test the sectors and attempt to fix
  them. Not all drives support this though.

So the attribute you're interested in at the moment is
Current_Pending_Sector. If this is not 0 then there's something up
with your disk. If Offline_Uncorrectable is less than
Current_Pending_Sectors then you may want to run an offline test which
may fix it, or you can dive straight in and use hdrecover which will
test (and attempt to fix) it itself.

So run (as root):

    hdrecover /dev/hda

and sit back and wait (or probably you're best off going and doing
something else while you wait). If the program comes across a bad
sector it will make several attempts at reading the sector. Between
each attempt it will randomly seek so as to reposition the head,
hopefully getting the data off the disk. If it succeeds then the drive
should automatically reallocate the sector. If after several attempts
the data still can't be read then the program will give you the option
of overwriting the data in the sector. This will force the drive to
reallocate the block.

WARNING: Overwriting the sector WILL cause data loss (it's fairly
obvious really!). Hopefully, since it is only one sector (or a handful
if there are more bad sectors on the drive), it won't be too
important. But bear in mind that you should at the very least run fsck
to check the integrity of the filesystem.

Once the program has finished (it takes a long time I'm afraid), a
summary will be printed showing how many blocks had errors. If you
repeat the smartctl command:

    smartctl -A /dev/hda

you should see that Current_Pending_Sector is now 0 and
Reallocated_Event_Count will have risen by the number of sectors the
drive decided to reallocate. Offline_Uncorrectable usually doesn't
immediately update - you have to either wait for the drive to update
it itself or run an offline test which should force the drive to
update it.

Have fun!

DISCLAIMER: Hard disks with bad sectors could fail at anytime -
although hdrecover appears to fix the drive you shouldn't trust it!
And just to re-inforce the GPL licence: if it in any way breaks your
computer then you get to keep both pieces! I accept no responsibility
for any damage it causes!

Notice there is 1 Current_Pending_Sector. Running hdrecover /dev/hdb
(it happens to be the second IDE drive):

Couldn't recover sector
The data for this sector could not be recovered. However, destroying the
contents of this sector (ie writing zeros to it) should cause the hard disk
to reallocate it making the drive useable again
Do you want to destroy the sector? [y/n]:

So the sector had to be wiped to recover it. fsck was then run to
check the metadata wasn't damaged (it wasn't) and smartctl now returns
the following attribute table:

Current_Pending_Sector is now 0 so the drive is 'fixed' (for
now). Also note that Reallocated_Event_Count hasn't gone up (it was 1
before). This means that the drive now has confidence in the sector
that has been overwritten and has not used a spare sector. Whether you
still have confidence in the drive is another matter!
